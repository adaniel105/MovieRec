Content: Verona Parker is easily one of the worst characters ever written for the screen, takes away everything this movie aspires to be. The actress also did a piss poor job and always had me cringing at the unrealistic and unreasonable choices she makes. If you'd delete that character entirely, this movie would've been a whole lot better in the long run.

Subject wise it's a very nice concept of a revenge thriller against scam call centers- but again, the whole govt mumbo jumbo makes it feel a whole run of the mill action BS from Hollywood mid tier movies. If the story had been awhole lot grounded, it would've done a whole lot better imo....

Content: Statham knows how to fight. The action is great.

The dialogs and the plot... oh my God. This was all written by a 15 year old as a weekend project.

It's all beyond ridiculous.

Even Statham's usual delivery can't salvage the "zinger" phrases in this movie. Not even that.

Still, the action is good.

Watch it for the action. With beer. With friends around, making fun of all the silly and teenage-amateurish dialogs.

You'll walk out thinking that you should not have enjoyed this horrible movie, and that you can also be a Hollywood screenwriter. Easily.

By the way, they spent 40 million to do this... I can only imagine Statham walked out of the movie loaded....

Content: The Beekeeper is a decently violent , sort of moronic Jason Bourne want-to-be. In it we get a Jason Statham who's more entertaining than the turgid "Wrath of Man", but falls short of his' action comedies , like "Snatch", "Expendables", and "Spy".

The action and violence are several notches above many other similar movies (though several floors below the likes of "John Wick" or "The Raid").

The movie tries to pretend it's a cerebral thriller , with commentary on avarice and political dirty dealings, but for the most part is a pretty plain revenge film.

The bad guys are annoying enough you look forward to their painful demises.

If you're looking to watch Jason Statham wander around and kill people , you could do worse....

Story 6/10 Agent Parker 1/10

The action and the story are great. Statham is fantastic.

Unfortunately, after that the other actors are bad or worse. Agent Parker was horrendous, shocking that she was even cast. If you can put her acting aside, then it's a pretty solid and enjoyable movie.

The Beekeeper is worth checking out if you enjoy action and Jason Statham. The movie is comparable to some of his better movies: transporter, the mechanic, crank, expendables. Again, for what it is and putting the bad supporting actors aside then it is enjoyable. Enjoy the action!...

Rating: 6/10
Content: So I rated this higher than it has a right to be rated but I don't want to take away from what could've been and what could be if there is a sequel.

This clandestine organization known as the Beekeepers is really compelling. I love the idea of this movie. However, the only good thing about this was Jason Statham and Jeremy Irons. The supporting actors were horrible and cartoonish. It went from being prospectively a terrific movie in the beginning, to just comical and not in a good B-movie (no pun intended) type of way.

The thing that destroyed this movie was the character writing. Statham's character didn't have much background and was an easy write as a typical elite action hero. Even so, they gave him some cheesy dialogue at times. Jeremy Irons was the only realistic character. Everyone else, especially the money folks, were like goofy caricatures of cartoon villains. His FBI tail, being his neighbor's (that he is avenging) daughter, had the most unrealistic plot line and character development you can imagine. She had zero grief nor internal conflict displayed. If they had gone a more serious direction, this movie would've been knockout. They should make a sequel with better writing....

Content: I seem to use that headline a lot. I guess it's better than a bad movie with bad fight scenes.

Starting with the good, Statham is awesome as usual. And I loved all of the fight scenes. They are ridiculously fast yet completely clear. It's hard hitting, you can feel the blows. This is enhanced by the beastly IMAX speakers. And with the R-rating, it doesn't hold back. Although it's far from gratuitous.

The bad? Sigh. The non-action scenes, which make up the majority of the movie, range from average to terrible. The quality level feels like a streaming movie, not a theatrical one. I spent much of the runtime uninterested and unengaged.

Everything feels off. The dialogue is weird. The acting is questionable. And there are a bunch of dumb things that strain believability. Like the entire bad guy organization. Or a laugh-out-loud idiotic character decision during the climax. A true "are you kidding me?" moment.

Even the cut to credits felt odd. Like the director just cut in the middle of a shot and said, "screw it, let's go home."

My almost 80 year old parents know more about computers than these morons in the movies and many more examples of that.

The action is great, as usual in Statham movies. That's why I even considered to write a review. It's everything one might expect from his action flick. As always he is the one who carries the movie throughout, and despite all the stupidity, it actually works. You probably need to be pretty drunk, but when you are, it's actually fun.

So, as a one time entertainment, it's actually worth it....

Content: David Ayer's "The Beekeeper" has Jason Statham going full John Wick and full Equalizer. This movie is 90 odd minutes of relentless, unhinged, pure escapist fun, with Statham doing what he does best - taking out bad guys like it's nothing and looking uber cool while doing it. He does that here in spades, in the most brutal and ridiculously entertaining ways. Yes, you need to throw believability aside, but if you are a fan of 80s and 90s action thrillers where it's one man against all, you will love this, just like I did. This movie really was a blast and a half, and then some. A great way to start 2024 movie season. I loved it. Pure escapist entertainment....

It almost seemed like a mix of comedy and action with some of these scenes being comically hilarious. The movie is exactly what you expect it to be, nothing more nothing less. It seemed liked the writers & director knew how absurd the plot was and embraced it well. If you looking for a straight action movie with some badass scenes then you will like this movie. Not to mention Josh Hutchinson did a great job playing a character which seemed to be almost identically based of the current President's son....

Nothing seemed to work, acting, storyline, everything was so rushed. The actors were incredibly bad, especially Parker. That must be some of the most cringe, b acting I have ever seen.

Content: The film's narrative hinges on outlandish scenarios and unbelievable action, often veering into unintentionally humorous territory due to its sheer absurdity of specific sequences.

While films, even those with mature content, can offer immersive experiences, 'The Beekeeper' falls short. Its graphic elements ('18' UK, 'R' US) juxtaposed with its stretched plot create a tonal disconnect that alienates its intended audience, leaving viewers unable to suspend disbelief.

While the film delivers the genre's requisite action sequences, the plot struggles to maintain credibility, often indulging in exaggerated scenarios that feel more amateurish than polished

Stepping out of a well-crafted movie is like emerging from a captivating dream, your mind buzzing with the story's echoes. Sadly, "The Beekeeper" left me thoroughly indifferent....

Rating: 7/10
Content: The Beekeeper isn't as tight or condensed as the films it borrows from thanks to an unexpectedly dense mythology but it really delivers where it counts. It's essentially Jason Statham beating people up for 100 minutes and it never gets old. Thankfully it doesn't really sequel bait however more of these would definitely be welcome.

Jason Statham is never bad even when he's in a dud like a few of his recent films. Even so, it's nice to see his talent and physicality employed in something actually good. Jeremy Irons has the ability to deliver exposition about beekeeping in an engaging manner and Josh Hutcherson is actually awake for this one.

Similarly to Statham, David Ayer has had a few misses so it's equally rewarding to see him back doing what he knows best whilst showing he and his team are really good at hand to hand combat. The score by David Sardy & Jared Michael Fry is a huge part of why this works, treating the dumbest twists with the utmost seriousness....

Content: A really enjoyable revenge action film full of fast paced action and corny bee-related dialogue. Although the character's backstory has been done many times before, the plot has some modern ideas and modern villains which are easy to hate and the strong moral message was quite refreshing. Good acting from a good cast of characters and whilst some of the henchmen are a bit silly, their larger than life presence adds some surprises into what is otherwise pretty standard fare. Good pacing, music and fight scenes keep it entertaining throughout, although the start is pretty slow and the ending rather abrupt....

Content: The Beekeeper buzzes with intensity as it unveils a gripping tale of vengeance that transcends personal vendettas to impact an entire nation. The film takes you on a relentless journey with one man, a former operative of the enigmatic 'Beekeepers.' What begins as a brutal campaign for personal justice quickly escalates into a high-stakes thriller with national consequences. The storytelling is a masterclass maybe mediocre in suspense, weaving a web of intrigue and unveiling layers of a clandestine organization. The protagonist's journey from a solitary avenger to a player in a larger, more dangerous game is both compelling, almost average and chilling. The Beekeeper delivers not only on the promise of riveting action but also explores the shadowy realms of power and conspiracy, making it a must-watch for any fans of gripping thrillers with a touch of espionage intrigue. The 6/10 is appropriate....

The whole movie is a budget-bin version of John Wick, which again is ok if you accept it for what it is.

The main down fall is the casting of Emmy Raver-Lampan, who is just a stunningly bad actress. It's impossible to believe her on onscreen, even in a popcorn flick.

Jeremy Irons is a welcome sight and lends credibility to the film, even though he doesn't get much screen time.

Once again, I find myself thoroughly entertained and very satisfied by one of Jason Statham's high octane, action films.

It's way over the top, and some of the dialogue is beyond abysmal, so corny, but the core essence is rather emotive, who hasn't been annoyed recently, hearing of some elderly person being scammed out of their life savings.

Some of the talk about bees is honestly cringe worthy, but that's the charm of the film, it's not trying to take itself too seriously.

Lots of great action scenes, very well staged, and Statham is just so cool.

On the debit side, Agent Parker isn't a particularly good character, and some of the American accents are a little dodgy, Jemma Redgrave's in particular is a little dodgy.

I really did enjoy it.

It's a Jason Statham action movie and does not deviate from the pattern. Heck, it's a lesser John Wick. And yet, yeah... the action is good. It's a mindless popcorn flick that escalates quickly, and some will love it for that, however, I see it maybe only being fun after having a few drinks and putting it on with a group of friends - it's pretty silly and very undemanding of its audience.

Content: I was excited to see a new action movie with Jason Statham (one of my favorite ACTION actors) and although his figting scenes are still okay (ish), they weren't exhilirating. But there is something worse...

The bad: Jason Statham (although in a leading role) doesnt get much screen time. A lot of the time we ONLY get to see a bunch of bland FBI agents, who arent impressing me in any way with their subpar acting performances.

Nor do these FBI agents come across as credible by the way, constantly missing Jason Statham when they have all the time and opportunity to kill him point blank. Quite silly.

More bad: the other supporting actors are really bad though, But they (AS WELL) do get a lot of screentime. So annoying.

Not any good? Actor Jeremy Irons nails it. He plays the role of a cunning sophisticated bad guy and he is terrific. But what the heck is the distinguished and superb actor Jeremy Irons doing in such a cheap looking action movie? HE is the only redeeming feature of this movie though, besides a few action scenes with Jason Statham.

Jason Statham fans beware, this one is quite a dud. Tedious, lame, uneventful....

Other than that the movie lacks any seriousness and the law enforcement roles are comical and everyone just comes out looking like keystone cops. It could have been so much better with a decent director and a lot of tweaks in the script.

Sadly, not enough going on here to please anything but the Jason fans. 3 stars for action, zero for everything else. Even the ending is a zero. Park your brain before watching, no thinking required....

Content: Important to put it like that.

This is the type of film I would expect from Statham. It reminds me of films like The Transporter and Crank but in fairness comparing The Bee Keeper to the others The Bee Keeper takes itself a little more seriously with a plot of standing up for the underdog ageist big business that makes the path of revenge this movie goes down even sweeter.

Statham takes his homage of the 80s action hero to a new level of invincibility that would humble Dominic Toretto. I mean some of the action sequences were just wild from beginning to end, but I ate it up!

Statham is serving up the best man meal i had for a while and its as sweet as Honey!...

Content: A good none brain thinking action movie. Plenty of things happen during the movie. Good amount of action, story line, acting, build-up time, etc, etc.

Jason Statham, as always, delivers his A-performance. At first I was doubtfull; will it not be a movie that is put togheter in less then 4 weeks? However it has a decent quality. People clearly thought about the story line before shooting it. The extra deepness of the story arround the ''bee-keepers'' instead of just acting the average middle class guy gave it a nice extra touch.

Just buy your snacks and drink and relax a bit! You will have a good easy time!...

Content: Typical Jason film but decent if wasn't for the "heroine".

What does she bring to the film at all ? She is a distraction and a disappointment every time she appears on screen.

The film would have been much better off without her. She is not credible at all and seems uncomfortable in that role, even clumsy.

She is obviously not built for this , and when I have watched her " the umbrella academy " ( I think ) it was more her style as not much was required of her... I have enjoyed watching Jason which I hadn't seen much of lately , but she has ruined my film experience. She tries to play a solid character who finds everything, sees everything, understands everything, knows everything , but in fact ruins everything... The rest of the cast were very good and although you can predict everything that will be happening next , the action scenes were good and almost credible ...;-)

7/10 for Jason's performance....

Content: Not sure why i went to see this one as i've not seen most of Jason Stathams movies. And if they're anything like this one i won't be in a rush to revisit them.

The movie looked dumb, and it is. Statham is a beekeeper. Both metaphorically and genuinely. Infact the worst part of the film isn't how repetitive and boring the action gets (where Statham is practically untouchable). But the cringey push to make ex-military beekeeper tough guys a thing. You'll definitely get some laughs from how ridiculous it all is. But half the time I couldn't really tell if they were intentional laughs or not.

I guess there is enough decent action. Like the farm scene, the middle office attack, and there's a decent brutal fight scene near the end. But even the most promising part of the movie - setting up the great villian for a well deserved ass kicking later. Doesn't pay off. So overall, pretty poor....

Rating: 8/10
Content: Preposterous but great fun if you can suspend your sense of belief.

Jason Statham is a retired and current beekeeper. In one definition of beekeeper he's a class A super-secret special forces operator, whereas Delta Force and Seals are class C. So he's incredibly skilled in martial arts, firearms and explosives. Plus other tricks to kill people.

In the other definition, he's a literal beekeeper in the countryside minding his own bee-zness until scammers empty his only friend (a kindly old lady) of all her bank accounts and the 2 miilion dollar fund she's in charge of. She tops herself and he takes it very badly and personally. He's the militant wing of kharma.

Through techniques not explained, this secretive organization that scams people out of their life savings, is easily discovered. Well, the techniques are calling his old contacts who have super searching capabilities.

Also very conveniently, it's just a short drive from where Jason lives. Apparently the FBI couldn't figure out who's doing the scamming or don't care. In reality this scam outfit / call center would be in the far east but, hey ho, that would make a more expensive movie with location challenges.

The only other person who cares is the daughter of the old lady / suicide victim, who coincidentally is an FBI agent. She cares but isn't very capable. She's sympathetic to his cause but also loyal to the rule of ineffective laws. Also, it turns out the main guy responsible for the scamming operation is the US president's wayward son. So he's untouchable by normal means but not by the beekeeper who can breach any security on the planet.

The rest is just tit-for-tat violence with Jason always prevailing. God damn it, he's super human which you have to accept because it doesn't make much sense how one man can defeat 10+ or well trained agents from .... pretty much any agency. FBI, Secret service, Delta / seals, mercaneries and even a rather pathetic current "beekeeper". The body count mounts.

Although it's preposterous and silly, it's good clean fun in Jon Wick style. Jason doesn't have to act but he (or his stunt team) do a stellar job.

Great fun! Just leave you thinking brain in sleep mode....

Content: This is a movie made very much in the image of John Wick (2014). With its overly privileged mogul villain (Josh Hutcherson) and his gang, to its neon tinged settings and innovative fights. But this David Ayer (Suicide Squad) directed brawler has a suave style that sets it apart from its inspiration.

It stars out pretty traditionally. Adam Clay (Jason Statham) is contently raising his honeybees and living with elderly Mrs. Parker (Phylicia Rashad) who shares her home with him. When a grave injustice leads to tragedy, it's time for vengeance! Meanwhile, FBI agent daughter Verona (Emmy Raver-Lampman) tries to bring the criminals responsible to justice herself. As she figures out just how deep the crime syndicate goes, she slowly realizes what her new acquaintance is capable of and what his title actually implies...

The slow buildup of Statham's titular character mirrors John Wick's introduction exactly. They both share a bond with something or someone they care for. Both are killed by an arrogant crime lord. We get an expositional speech rife with one-liners, this time delivered by Jeremy Irons (The Lion King). The colour palette switches from a soothing beehive yellow and white to over-saturated fluorescent as the film progresses. They even have the old-timely phone operator scene. Switchboard and neon green computer monitors to boot!

The parallels to Wick are immediately apparent. One might even call it a new sequel... or a rip-off depending on your viewpoint. The lasting impact of a film can be evident in its imitations. The film White House Down (2014), is similar to the classic Die Hard (1987) as Beekeeper is to Wick. The beats and characters of those films are exactly the same, yet the two directors trademarks differentiate and make them uniquely their own. This film shows that if the formula works, it can still be successful and entertaining, even when repeated.

There's a purity to the fights themselves. Very well choreographed and interesting sequences mostly free of CGI. The film trades in Wick's smooth and streamlined long takes for more traditional "shaky-cam", however there's not so much static as to distract you from the brilliant fights. The action set pieces include a vivisection by a falling elevator, a mini-gun fight at a gas station and a Wick style mirror hall featuring a very South African mercenary with a metal leg.

Because of the practicality of the fights, the stakes are much easier to buy into. It feels much "realer" than most action blockbusters today. In this movie, they used special effects sparingly while what could be done without them was kept practical. They definitely understood the task of making a stunt-driven action flick.

It's by no means perfect though. There's some choppy editing and some pretty sweaty lines throughout, the majority of which are delivered by Lampman's character, agent Verona Parker. Her only purpose is basically to verbally speak the metaphors of the film to the viewers. The symbolism isn't very subtle by itself either. It has a real problem of underestimating viewer intelligence pretty frequently. The fact that she was allowed to be put in the case of her mother's death immediately without any regard for her being easily emotionally compromised is pretty unlikely.

The conflicting morals of her and Clay are actually very good conceptually. Verona represents the laws that exist to protect and to serve the public. Clay is that one that is willing to do whatever it takes, no matter what, to see that justice is served. Because of the corrupt system that allowed these horrible things to happen, Clay's only solution is the attack the system itself. There's essentially a battle between two sides of the same coin going on throughout. Because of that, although Parker is the weakest character, what she symbolizes makes dynamic between her and the Beekeeper stronger.

The film does hint at a broader universe throughout and also sets up future stories for Clay and the others he's met on his mission. While leaving many things open ended can be irritating at this point, it definitely does earn it. Given this movie's success, there's no doubt we'll be getting more of these movies in the future.

Like Wick, The Beekeeper is a fun adrenaline ride that will leave you wanting more....

Content: As a fan of Jason Statham, I took all my family members with me to a nearby Le Reve theatre in Bandra West. My family was like 'yo man!' This is a fast paced action thriller n has some very brutal scenes for which it is rated as an adult viewing n cos of that my daughter was asked to show her age proof thrice.

I hope the film becomes a franchise like John Wick n The Equalizer.

This one is hundred times better than the lousy n terrible Expandables 4 which I saw in the same theatre. (In Expandables 4 Iko Uwais is totally wasted. He is such a treat to watch for his Silat n martial arts techniques).

Coming back to this film, this one moves at a soild pace n the action is non stop....

Content: Who doesn't love a good action movie hero.?

Jason Statham never fails to deliver in his movies, and although most are over the top, non stop never ending and unrealistic action, they are easy to watch and thoroughly enjoyable.

Over the decades we see many action movie heroes, and Jason seems to have firmly found his place in Hollywood.

The acting is quite good, the fighting and action scenes are very much over the top, but what else would you be watching an action movie for.?

This movie is certainly not going to challenge any viewer, but it delivers on entertainment to the max.

Sit back, relax, and enjoy Jason doing his thing....

Content: This will be quick... everything about this film is hilariously bad. The script is bad, the writing is bad, and the dialogue is bad. It was so bad that I couldn't help but feel it was parody of itself because of how serious they took this subject matter.

The premise is so laughable in its stupidity. If it wasn't for Statham and the surprisingly amazing action sequences, choreography, and great sound effects, this film would've been a complete waste of time.

Jason Statham plays the Beekeeper who is essentially Jason Bourne, John Wick, and Agent 47 levels of badass. Jason Statham, to his credit, makes this whole Beekeeper "society" work as he is a sort of agent outside the government that protects society. He is retired now but is forced out to write a wrong against someone who cared for him. At it's core this film is nothing more than a paint by numbers action revenge movie. Unfortunately, it does it all in the most horrendous of ways.

Then, if the story wasn't already horrible enough, the ending left my friend and I laughing. It literally, and I am not exaggerating here, just ends the cut to credits is the most erupt ending I've seen in a movie. If this ending is supposed to be set up to a possible sequel, I say NO!

This year is not starting so well, but it is only January. This is commonly the slow time when it comes to movie releases. So if you are desperate enough and I mean desperate then maybe you can garner some entertainment from The Beekeeper but expect nothing from the story or characters turn your brain off enjoy your popcorn, your beverage, and good action.
