# MovieRec

A recommendation system that recommends movies to users based on a similarity to movies which they already like (item-item similarity). 
This similarity or "nearness in distance" is calculated using the cosine similarity metric, which is a useful tool for measuring the angle between two vectors defined in a multi-dimsensional space.

# Dataset Description

The dataset used is the MovieLens 100k dataset, consisting of 100,000 ratings of movies by users.
